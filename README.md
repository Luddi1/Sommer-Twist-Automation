# Sommer Twist Automation
 Add-On PCB and ESPHome software to read gate state of Sommer twist 200 (and similar) to implement open and close commands

**Problem**:  Sommer Twist 200 (and similar) gate controllers only have an impulse-input. When toggling this input an open gate closes, closed gate opens and a moving gate stops. 
However, to integrate this into a smarter setup, distinct commands for _open_ and _close_ are needed. 

**Solution**: We read out the LEDs on the gate controller PCB which indicate whether the gate opens or closes, save the state and toggle the impulse-input, depending on the current state and the desired command.

This solution needs no hardware hacks on the original Sommer controller. 
Find below the contents of the repository, BOMs for the read-out PCB and the overall system.

Some notes:
* The printed parts are designed for ABS. Other materials will probably work, too. 
* Keep the cable run for the SommerAdapter PCB as short as possible and avoid runs next to other cables. 
* Flash ESPHome to ASTRA controller and set to SPI mode. See [manual](https://templates.blakadder.com/assets/ASTRA_controller.pdf). Use SPI (left) RJ12 socket. We need the GPIOs and GND/3.3V to power our board.
